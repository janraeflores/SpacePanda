# SpacePanda
Plum the Panda is a fearless space explorer and a dreamer, working tirelessly to become a world renowned astronaut and explorer of unknown space. Day in day out Plum is working.. which means he's constantly hungry. The thing is, he only eats pizza! Sweets like those darn cookie-roids (asteroids) always upset his stomach. With quick reflexes and a keen mind, Plum's goal is to maneuver past all the obstacles to safety. 

Are you ready for an out-of-this-world adventure with Plum the Panda, the fearless astronaut and space explorer? Join Plum the Panda on his mission to get to safety in a galaxy far, far away. But beware, the journey will be far from easy - Plum will have to master his reflexes and sharpen his mind to dodge all the cookie-roids in his away. Strap on your spacesuit, grab a slice of pizza, and join Plum on his epic journey!

# How to Play
