# SpacePanda
SpacePanda is a simple 2D scroller where a hungry panda floats across space. Since the panda is busy eating a pizza already, he must dodge all the asteroids (or should I say cookieroids) and get the finish! This was my first attempt at making a 2D game (any game in fact), using Go programming language and the Ebitenengine. 

# How to Play
The goal is simple, to float across space to the end line. Of course, while dodging all the obstacles. You may control the panda by using your keyboard arrow inputs (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to dodge and maneouver across space. The game is finished when the panda reaches the other end. 

# How to Build and Run
To build and run SpacePanada, you will need Go 1.20.XX and Git installed on your device.
- If required, install Go 1.20: https://go.dev/dl/
- If required, install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

In your terminal, follow the below steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/janraefloresSAIT/SpacePanda.git
2. Change into the respository directory: cd SpacePanda
3. Run the game: go run main.go
